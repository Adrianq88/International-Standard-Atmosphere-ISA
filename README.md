# International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) - MATLAB Program

## Project Description
This project contains a MATLAB program that calculates atmospheric parameters based on the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). The program allows obtaining data such as atmospheric pressure, atmospheric air density, atmospheric temperature, and the speed of sound depending on the input altitude.

## Features
- Calculate atmospheric temperature based on altitude and generate a plot illustrating the relationship between atmospheric temperature and altitude.
- Calculate atmospheric pressure based on altitude.
- Calculate atmospheric air density based on altitude.
- Calculate the speed of sound in the atmosphere based on altitude.

## System Requirements
The program requires the MATLAB environment to run.

## How to Use
1. Run the 'wybor_menu' program in the MATLAB environment after ensuring that all five files are downloaded and located in the same folder.
2. Input the desired altitude.
3. The program will return values for atmospheric pressure, air density, atmospheric temperature, and the speed of sound for the given altitude.
